During our 2nd year of computer science degree, we made a java software allowing management of a bookstore.

This software includes these features :

- identify / create a store 
- create / modify / delete customers, books, employees, expenses
- making a purchase
- visualization of the statistics of customers, books, employees, sales
- estimate total revenue
